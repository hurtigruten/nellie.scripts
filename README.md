# nellie.scripts

The purpose of this repository is to centralise and store repeat use scripts associated with the nellie platform.

The benefits of this are:

1. a record of different repeatable tasks
2. a record of genesis and changes to script
3. visibiity over the code
4. a shareable repo that provides more context e.g. a README.md (and is something that POs can link to)
5. makes dependencies visible (if for example, a script is run using python, the author can include a Pipfile)
